# movie-recommendation-system
Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System** repository! This project implements a simple movie recommendation system using Python and pandas. The goal is to recommend movies similar to a selected movie based on user ratings and correlation.

## Overview
This project is divided into multiple sections, starting with:

### Section A: Simple Recommendation System
In this section, we:
- Use Python and pandas to develop a basic recommendation system.
- Suggest movies similar to a particular movie using correlation-based methods.
- Employ the `corrwith()` function to compute correlations between movies based on user ratings.
- Sort and rank movies by correlation to suggest the most similar titles.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset:** We use a dataset containing movie ratings provided by multiple users.
2. **Correlation Calculation:** Using the pandas library, we calculate correlations between movies based on user ratings.
3. **Recommendation:** Sort movies by correlation scores to recommend similar movies.

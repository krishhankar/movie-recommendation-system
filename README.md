# recommendation-system
Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System** repository! This project implements a simple movie recommendation system using Python and pandas. The goal is to recommend movies similar to a selected movie based on user ratings and correlation.

## Overview
This project is divided into multiple sections, starting with:

### Section A: Simple Movie Recommendation System
In this section, we:
- Use Python and pandas to develop a basic recommendation system.
- Suggest movies similar to a particular movie using correlation-based methods.
- Employ the `corrwith()` function to compute correlations between movies based on user ratings.
- Sort and rank movies by correlation to suggest the most similar titles.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset:** We use a dataset containing movie ratings provided by multiple users.
2. **Correlation Calculation:** Using the pandas library, we calculate correlations between movies based on user ratings.
3. **Recommendation:** Sort movies by correlation scores to recommend similar movies.


### Section B: Product Recommendation System
Recommends products (like movies) to a specific user based on their preferences.

## How It Works

1. We use User-Product Rating data to find products rated by similar users.
2. It focuses on Collaborative Filtering, considering both the preferences of the user and other usersâ€™ behavior.

### Section C: Content-Based Recommendation System
Recommends movies similar to a particular movie by looking at its content.

## How It Works

1. Uses CountVectorizer to transform genres, keywords, and tags into numerical vectors.
2. Computes Cosine Similarity to find which films are most similar in content.
